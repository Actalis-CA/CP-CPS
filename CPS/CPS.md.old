## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 OVERVIEW

**Actalis S.p.A.** , a company of the Aruba S.p.A. group, is a leading provider of certification services since 2002, accredited by AgID under the European Directive on Electronic Signatures, then under the European Regulation EU n.910/2014 (“eIDAS”). Actalis offers several types of certificates and related management services, as well as other trust services and solutions (www.actalis.it).

A certificate binds a public key to a set of information that identifies an entity (individual or organization). This entity, the certificate Subscriber, possesses and utilizes the corresponding private key. The certificate is generated and supplied to the Subscriber by a trusted third party known as **Certification Authority** (CA). The certificate is digitally signed by the CA.

The reliability of a certificate, in particular the association - attested by the certificate - between a given public key and a given identity, also depends on the CA’s operating procedures, the obligations and responsibilities of the CA and the certificate Subscriber, and the CA’s physical and logical security controls. All these aspects are described in a public document called **Certification Practice Statement** (CPS).

This document is the Actalis’ CPS relevant to the issuance and management of two types of certificates:

- SSL Server certificates
- Code Signing certificates

The structure of this CPS conforms to the public specification [RFC 3647].

As regards the **SSL Server** certificates regulated by this CPS, Actalis conforms to the current version of the **Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates** and the **Guidelines for Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates** published at [http://www.cabforum.org.](http://www.cabforum.org.) In the event of any inconsistency between this CPS and those documents, those documents take precedence.

As regards the **Code Signing** certificates regulated by this CPS, Actalis conforms to the current version of the **Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Code Signing Certificates** published at [http://www.cabforum.org.](http://www.cabforum.org.) If there is any inconsistency between this CPS and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence.

### 1.2 DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

This document is the **Certification Practice Statement** ( **CPS** ) applying to **SSL Server and Code Signing certificates** issued by **Actalis S.p.A.** Version and time of last revision are indicated on the first page. This document is published on Actalis’ web site in two languages: Italian and English. In the event of any inconsistency between the two versions, the Italian version takes precedence.

Actalis also issues other types of certificates (e.g., SSL Client, S/MIME) in compliance with policies described in separate documents. Those policies may refer to this CPS for all common aspects (e.g., infrastructure, organization, physical and operational security, etc.).

This CPS is published as a signed PDF document in order to ensure its origin and integrity.


### 1.3 PKI PARTICIPANTS

#### 1.3.1 Certification Authorities

The Certification Authority (CA) is the trusted third party who issues the certificates and signs them with its own private key (CA key). Furthermore, the CA manages the status of the certificates.

The Actalis PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) that the SSL Server and Code Signing certificate issuance and management service is based upon is a two-level hierarchy, as shown in the following diagram:

The **Root CA** is used for issuing Sub CA certificates and related CRLs only, and is kept off-line when not in use,whereas end-entity certificates are issued by **Sub CA**s.

Within the framework of the service described in this document, the role of Root CA is played by the Italian company Actalis S.p.A. (hereinafter referred to as “Actalis”), identified as follows:

```
Company name: Actalis S.p.A.
Registered Office: Via San Clemente 53 – 24036 Ponte S. Pietro (BG) – ITALY
Legal representative: Massimiliano Carollo (Chief Executive Officer)
VAT Reg. No. and Tax Code: 03358520967
Telephone (switchboard): +39 0575 050.

```
1.3.1.1 Root Certification Authorities

As anticipated, the role of Root CA is played by Actalis. As of the date of revision of this present CPS, Actalis’ RootCA keys are those identified in the following table; for further details, see chapter 7.

Subordinate CA certificates can be issued to **external CAs** (i.e. not run by Actalis), under an Actalis’ Root CA, provided that the entities running those external CAs commit in writing to fully comply with CAB Forum’s Baseline Requirements [BR], via a suitable **contract** with Actalis^1.

Unless an external CA is technically constrained in compliance with section 7 .1.2.3, 7.1.2.4 and 7.1.2.5 of the [BR], such CA shall submit itself to a **compliance audit on an annual basis** , performed by a **qualified and independent auditor** according to chapter 8 of the [BR], and timely provide to Actalis the resulting audit statement every year. Lacking such audit statement, Actalis will revoke the SubCA certificate. Furthermore, Actalis reserves the right to revoke the SubCA certificate in case the related audit statement has major qualifications, at the sole judgement of Actalis.

 [^1]  Issuance of EV certificates by external SubCAs, under an Actalis’ Root CA, is currently not allowed.

#### 1.3.2 Registration Authorities

The Registration Authority (RA) is a person or an organization that is responsible for:

- collection and validation of certification requests and certificate management requests;
- registration of the Applicant, and related information, into the RA database;
- authorization of issuance, by the CA, of the requested certificates.

For EV certificates, all RA activities shall generally be performed by Actalis only.

For DV and OV certificates only, the CA may delegate some RA tasks to Delegated Third Parties (DTP), except for the validation of domain / IP address ownership or control that remains the sole responsibility of the CA.

Organizations meeting the requirements for “Enterprise RAs” set forth in the [BR] may be enabled to operate as their own RA, limited to the domains and IP addresses they own or control.

#### 1.3.3 Subscribers

Subscribers are those legal entities or individuals to whom Certificates are issued according to this CPS and who hold the private keys corresponding to their certificates. In particular:

- for OV and EV SSL Server certificates, the Subscriber may only be a legal entity (i.e., an organization);
- for DV SSL Server and Code Signing certificates, the Subscriber may be either a legal entity or an individual.

Except for DV SSL Server certificates, which by definition do not include Subject identity information, the Subscriber is the party identified in the Subject field of the certificate.

Prior to verification of identity and issuance of a certificate, any requesting Subscriber is defined as an **Applicant**.
Once the Certificate is issued, the Applicant is referred to as the **Subscriber**.

The Customer, namely the individual or organization that purchases the certificate, is normally the Subscriber itself, but this is not a requirement (another entity may purchase the certificate on behalf of the Subscriber).

#### 1.3.4 Relying parties

Relying Parties are recipients of a certificate who act on reliance on the information contained in the certificate. In the case of an SSL Server certificate, these are (for instance) the users of the relevant web site. For Code Signing certificates, these are typically the users of the signed software.


#### 1.3.5 Resellers

Certificates may also be provided through Resellers (business partners), which in certain cases may also play the role of Registration Authorities, depending on the agreements with the CA.

### 1.4 CERTIFICATE USAGE

#### 1.4.1 Appropriate certificate uses

Certificates issued under this CPS may be used for the following purposes, depending on certificate type:

- **SSL Server certificates** may be used to enable the TLS/SSL protocol on one or more servers.
- **Code Signing certificates** may be used for validating digital signatures of executable code.

A list of major platforms and browsers where certificates issued according to this CPS are trusted can be found on Actalis’ web site at the following URL: https://www.actalis.it/products/ssl-certificate.aspx. Applicants are supposed to review that list before requesting certificates.

The CA may also issue other types of certificates (e.g. SSL Client, S/MIME) that are not entirely regulated by this CPS, but in separate policy documents that refer to this CPS for the shared aspects (e.g. facility, management and operational controls, technical security controls, Root CAs, etc.).

It is assumed that the Applicant possesses the competence and tools necessary to request, install and use the certificate. Actalis can provide consultancy on request, as a separate service.

The following table shows the **classes** and **policies** of certificates issued under this CPS, and the applicable CAB Forum requirements. Each policy is identified by a specific **OID** (Object Identifier) under the Actalis arc **1.3.159** :
|Class |Certificate policy | OID | CABF reqs.|
|--|--|--|--|
|EV| SSL Server EV (Extended Validation) | 1.3.159.1.17.1 |  [BR], [EVGL]  |
|OV| SSL Server Wildcard OV (Organization Validated)  | 1.3.159.1.19.1|  [BR] |  |
|OV| SSL Server OV (Organization Validated) | 1.3.159.1.20.1 | [BR] |  |
|OV| Code Signing (Organization Validated) |  1.3.159.1.21.1| [BR] | 
|DV| SSL Server DV (Domain Validated) |  1.3.159.1.22.1|[BR]  |  
|DV| SSL Server Wildcard DV (Domain Validated) | 1.3.159.1.23.1 | [BR] | 

The OID that identifies the certificate policy is contained in the _CertificatePolicies_ certificate extension, as detailed in chapter 7. The same extension also contains the applicable policy OID defined by CAB Forum.

In the case of _qualified_ certificates according to the eIDAS regulation (see par. 7.1), the CertificatePolicies extension also includes the relevant policy OID defined in ETSI EN 319 411-2.

#### 1.4.2 Prohibited certificate uses

Any use of the certificate other than provided for in section 1.4.1 is forbidden and may result, as soon as Actalis is made aware of it, in the revocation of the certificate (see also section 4.9.1).

Actalis reserves the right to put in operation new subordinate i.e., intermediate CAs (ICAs) when needed according to its own determinations, and to stop issuing certificates from the old ones. In some circumstances, Actalis may also need to revoke certain ICAs before their natural expiration.

Actalis therefore strongly recommends that _ICA certificates not be embedded into applications and/or platforms_.

Actalis strongly discourages “ _certificate pinning_ " and does not consider it a sufficient reason to delay revocation.

Subscribers should not use certificates trusted for the web in contexts where there is no such need (e.g., on private networks), especially where a quick replacement of certificates is not viable.

Subscribers and relying parties should keep in mind that any certificates _trusted_ by the browsers must comply with all requirements of all applicable browser _root policies_ , including the revocation periods recalled in section 4.9.1 of this CPS.

### 1.5 POLICY ADMINISTRATION

#### 1.5.1 Organization administering the document

This CPS is developed, reviewed, published and updated by Actalis S.p.A.

#### 1.5.2 Contact person

For any enquiries about this CPS, please send e-mail to cps-admin@actalis.it.

Actalis makes available to all interested parties (Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, law enforcement, etc.) two communication channels through which certificate problems can be reported to the CA at any time (24x7):

- the mailbox **cert-problem@actalis.it** , which the CA commits to timely read during working hours only (9 AM to 5 PM on Italian working days);
- the telephone number **+39- 0575 - 050.376** , at which Actalis commits to answer at all times (24x7x 365 ).

These channels cannot be used to request technical assistance of any kind, but only to report problems (such as misissuance, use of the certificate for unlawful purposes, etc.) that may warrant the revocation of the involved certificates.

Regardless of the communication channel used, the problem reporter must provide at least the following information, or the communication will be ignored:

- his/her full name;
- description of the alleged problem;
- enough information to identify the certificate in question, such as:
    - for an SSL Server certificate: either the address of the web site where the certificate is installed,
       or the certificate hostname, starting validity date, and serial number;
    - for a Code Signing certificate: commonName (CN), starting validity date, and serial number.

Such communications may be made in Italian or English; other languages are not handled.

The CA is committed to take charge of _proper communications_ within 24 hours, start investigating the reported problem, and take the necessary measures, depending on the problem severity. The priority assigned to the problem will depend on:


- the nature of the alleged problem;
- the identity of the reporter (reports received by a Court or law enforcement agents will be handled     with higher priority than other messages);
- the law and/or regulations relevant for the alleged problem (e.g., reports of illegal acts will be handled     with higher priority than other messages).

If the reported problem does exist, the CA will decide on a case-by-case basis the measures to be taken (e.g., revocation of the certificate) and will notify the reporter by e-mail.

Note: those who send unwanted messages (spam) will be prosecuted according to applicable laws.

#### 1.5.3 Person determining CPS suitability for the policy

This CPS is approved by Actalis’ CA services direction, after review by all internal stakeholders, taking into account the Requirements [BR] and Guidelines [EVGL], and the results and recommendations received from qualified auditors (see also section 8).

#### 1.5.4 CPS approval procedures

Approval of this CPS follows the procedures defined in the company’s Quality Management System. This CPS is reviewed and updated at least yearly, i.e., within 365 days since the last update.

## 2 PUBLICATIONS AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES

The term “repository” refers to a combination of on-line archives or registers containing information of public interest regarding the issuance and management of certificates described in this CPS.

### 2.1 REPOSITORIES

The Actalis repository is published on:

- the Actalis website (http://www.actalis.it and other Actalis websites therein referred to)

Actalis manages its repository and is directly responsible for it.
The repository is normally accessible on a continuous basis (7x24).

### 2.2 PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION

Actalis publishes at least the following documentation on its website:

- Certification Practice Statement (CPS)
- Root CA and SubCA certificates
- Terms & Conditions
- audit statements
- application forms

Actalis also publishes test web pages that allow Application Software Suppliers to test their software with Subscriber certificates that chain up to Actalis’ publicly trusted Root CAs.

### 2.3 TIME OR FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATIONS

This CPS and any associated documents are published on the CA web site each time they are updated.

This CPS is reviewed and updated at least every year, also to ensure that it conforms to the latest versions of CAB Forum Requirements and Guidelines [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL], and other applicable standards and regulations.

See also section 4.10.

### 2.4 ACCESS CONTROL ON REPOSITORIES

Anyone can freely access the repository in read-only mode.

Access to the repository in write-mode (e.g., for the publication of new or updated information) is only possible from workstations / servers directly connected to the repository’s local network, subject to authentication.


## 3 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (I&A)

The I&A procedures followed by Actalis comply with CAB Forum requirements. In particular, for all classes of certificates issued under this CPS, the CA performs at least the mandatory checks provided in [BR] and [CSBR]. In addition, for EV certificates, the CA also performs at least the additional checks required by the [EVGL].

### 3.1 NAMING

#### 3.1.1 Types of names

Certificates issued according to this CPS normally contain a non-null Distinguished Name (DN) compliant with the ITU-T X.500 standard (ISO/IEC 9594) in both the Subject and the Issuer fields.

The Subject field may be _empty_ in DV (Domain Validated) certificates, e.g., when it cannot accommodate a very long FQDN (> 64 chars); in such a case, the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension is flagged as _critical_.

Furthermore, all the requirements set forth in the [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL] shall be met.

In particular, all SSL Server certificates shall include entries in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension, where each entry is either a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or an IP address. However, IP addresses are not allowed in DV (Domain Validated) and EV (Extended Validation) SSL Server certificates.

3.1.1.1 Internal names and reserved IP addresses

Internal Names and/or Reserved IP Addresses (see the respective definitions in [BR]) are not allowed.

3.1.1.2 Internationalized domain names (IDNs)

No stipulation.

#### 3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful

Actalis inserts meaningful names in both the _subject_ and the _issuer_ fields of certificates, with the possible exception of the Subject field in DV certificates as previously noted.

#### 3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers

Except for SSL Server certificates of class DV (Domain Validated), which by definition do not contain Subscriber identification information, in all other cases the certificate contains either the official (i.e. registered) name of the Subscriber or a verified DBA (Doing Business As) name.

#### 3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms

All name forms shall be interpreted according to the ITU-T X.500 (ISO/IEC 9594) and the RFC 5820 standards, also taking into account CAB Forum’s Requirements [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL] according to certificate type and class.

#### 3.1.5 Uniqueness of names

No stipulation.


#### 3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks

Names that violate the intellectual property rights of others are not allowed into certificates. Actalis shall not be involved in any controversy whatsoever regarding the ownership of domain names, commercial names, commercial trademarks or services. Actalis reserves the right to reject the certificate application (or revoke an already issued certificate) in case of such a controversy.

### 3.2 INITIAL IDENTITY VALIDATION

#### 3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key

The proof-of-possession, by the Applicant, of the private key corresponding to the requested certificate is based on the cryptographic verification of the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) sent to the CA. In fact, the Applicant must transmit its public key to the CA in the form of a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) in PKCS#10 format [RFC2314]. The CA shall verify that the digital signature in the CSR is valid.

#### 3.2.2 Authentication of organization and domain identity

3.2.2.1 Identity

When the certificate is to include the name or address of an organization, the CA shall verify the identity and address of the organization, and that the address is the Applicant’s address of existence or operation. This verification is done in compliance with the CAB Forum’s requirements [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL] according to certificate type and class.

Actalis will normally query:

- for private organizations, the relevant company registry for the applicable jurisdiction or an equivalent     private or governmental source of organization information meeting the requirements of §3.2.2.7;
- for public entities, the relevant official index or registry of public entities for the applicable jurisdiction.

In the event that the consultation of the above sources is not possible, or returns incomplete or obsolete information about the Applicant (e.g., registered identity and brands, address, phone numbers, contact persons, etc.), Actalis may accept an Attestation Letter signed by a lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party customarily relied upon for such information in the Applicant's jurisdiction, attesting to that information. Jointly with this document, it will also be necessary to make a copy of the license or different document proving the role of the third party available. This information must be written in Italian or, if in a different language, it must also be written in English.

Other information sources meeting the requirements of section 3.2.2.7 (see below) may also be used, at Actalis’sole discretion, depending on circumstances, to corroborate the information obtained from the above sources.

For EV SSL Server certificates, the approved information sources used for validating the Applicant’s identity are  those published on the Actalis website at the following address:
https://www.actalis.it/documenti-en/actalis-approved-incorporation-agencies.aspx.
This list of approved information sources is monitored and updated over time by the CA to ensure the highest standard of accuracy and reliability of the information provided.


The name of the Applicant must match the organization name resulting from such lookups. In case of mismatch (except for negligible differences like e.g., uppercase/lowercase, non-meaningful diacritics, or punctuation), unless the Applicant can provide explanatory evidence, the certificate application will be rejected. Any ambiguity must be solved by the Applicant.

The CA may use the same information sources to also verify the Applicant’s address(es). When the claimed Applicant’ address cannot be verified in that way, the Applicant will be required to provide to the CA a utility bill, or a bank or credit card statement reporting the Applicant’s full address. Other forms of evidence may also be accepted by the CA, subject to a case-by-case evaluation by the CA.

The information gathered by the CA include at least:

- actual existence and status of the Applicant organization
- legal (i.e., registered) name of the Applicant organization
- full address of the Applicant organization’s heads office and operation sites
- the Applicant organization’s registration number issued by the relevant jurisdiction
- the Applicant organization’s VAT and/or fiscal code or equivalent (where applicable)
- the Applicant organization general phone and/or fax number(s), if available
- the Applicant organization general email address(es), if available

As a rule, should the CA not be able to collect the above information by itself, the Applicant will be required to provide it to the CA, subject to the subsequent CA’s evaluation of the trustworthiness of the provided information in view of the minimal requirements set forth in the [BR], [CSBR], and [EVGL].

For EV-class certificates, the CA shall also verify:

- **physical existence** of the Applicant (or an affiliate thereof) in line with section 11.4 of [EVGL];
- **operational existence** of the Applicant (or an affiliate thereof) in line with section 11.6 of [EVGL].

For the second item, Actalis will normally check that the Applicant has been in existence for at least 3 years, by querying reliable information sources, or ask the Applicant to prove possession of a demand deposit (or equivalent) bank account. To that aim, the Applicant may provide to the CA a letter of bank reference, dated and signed by the bank, on the bank’s headed paper.

Actalis reserves the right to reject a certificate request in the event that it encounters problematic situations (e.g., bankruptcy proceedings, disputes, insolvency, etc.) involving the Applicant or am Applicant Representative.

3.2.2.2 DBA/Tradename

If the Subject the certificate is to include a DBA or trade name (not applicable to DV-class SSL Server certificate), the CA shall verify the Applicant’s right to use the DBA/trade name with at least one of the criteria provided for in [BR], [CSBR] or [EVGL] according to certificate type and class.

3.2.2.3 Verification of country

When the certificate Subject is to include a country code (not applicable to DV-class SSL Server certificates), the CA shall verify the country using one of the methods provided for in section 3.2.2. 3 of the [BR].


3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control

Prior to issuing an **SSL Server** certificate, the CA shall verify that **each FQDN** to be included in the certificate **either is owned or controlled by the Applicant** or an affiliate thereof (e.g., parent or subsidiary). These checks (also referred to as Domain Control Validation or DCV) are done by one of the following methods:

- The CA confirms, by directly querying the Domain Name Registrar, that the Applicant is the Domain    Registrant. This method may only be used if the Base Domain Name is registered by Aruba S.p.A. (that    is the Actalis’ holding company). This method is implemented in compliance with §3.2.2.4.12 of [BR].
- The CA sends a Random Value via e-mail to an address obtained by pre-pending “admin@”, or     “administrator@”, or “webmaster@”, or “hostmaster@”, or “postmaster@” to the Authorization     Domain Name, and receives a confirming response utilizing the Random Value. This method is     implemented in compliance with §3.2.2.4.4 of [BR].
- The CA asks the Applicant to publish a file on the HTTP server at the target FQDN, under the     "/.well-known/pki‐validation" directory, containing a Random Value provided by the CA, and then     confirms the presence of such file, with the expected contents. As of December 1, 2021, this method     cannot be used for wildcard FQDNs and does not cover subdomains of the validated domain. This     method is implemented in compliance with §3.2.2.4.18 of [BR].
- The CA asks the Applicant to publish a file on the HTTP server at the target FQDN, under the     "/.well-known/acme-challenge" directory, according to section 8.3 of RFC8555 [ACME], containing the     value provided by the CA, and then confirms the presence of such file, with the expected contents. As     of December 1, 2021, this method cannot be used for wildcard FQDNs and does not cover subdomains     of the validated domain. This method is implemented in compliance with §3.2.2.4.19 of [BR].
- The CA asks the Applicant to insert a TXT record, containing a Random Value provided by the CA,   into the DNS information of the Authorization Domain Name, and then confirms the presence of     such record with the expected contents. This method is implemented in compliance with §3.2.2.4.17 of     [BR].
- The CA confirms that the Applicant controls an IP address returned from a DNS lookup for A or AAAA     records for the FQDN in line with section 3.2.2.5. This method may not be used for wildcard FQDNs.   This method is implemented in compliance with §3.2.2.4.8 of [BR].

Note: in the above list of DCV methods, the “Authorization Domain Name” is obtained by pruning zero or more components from the requested FQDN, up to and excluding a public suffix or registry-controlled label.

In all cases, the DCV is done in full compliance with section 3.2.2.4 of the [BR], and no DCV methods are employed by the CA other than those provided for in the [BR].

The particular DCV method used for a given FQDN may depend on circumstances, on the certificate requestor’s preferences. The range of supported DCV methods may vary depending on the certificate request channel.

3.2.2.5 Authentication for an IP Address

Prior to issuing an **SSL Server** certificate, the CA shall verify that **all IP addresses** to be included in the certificate (excluding DV and EV certificates that may not contain IP addresses) **are controlled by the Applicant** or an affiliated thereof (e.g. holding or subsidiary). These checks are done by one of the following methods:

- the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the IP Address by publishing a file on the HTTP server     at the target IP, under the "/.well-known/pki‐validation" directory, containing a Random Value    provided by the CA; the CA confirms the presence of such file, with the expected contents;
- the CA sends a Random Value via e-mail to an IP Address Contact, obtained by consulting the Internet     Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or a Regional Internet Registry (RIPE, APNIC, ARIN, AfriNIC,  LACNIC), and receives a confirming response utilizing the Random Value;
- performing a reverse‐IP address lookup and then verifying control over the resulting Domain Name   according to section 3.2.2.4.

3.2.2.6 Wildcard Domain Validation

Prior to issuing an **SSL Server** certificate, if the certificate is to include a **wildcard FQDN** in the Subject common-Name (CN) or in the Subject Alternative Name extension, the CA shall determine if the wildcard character would fall within the label immediately to the left of a registry‐controlled or public suffix; in such a case, the CA shall reject the certificate request unless the Applicant proves its rightful control of the entire Domain Namespace.

For this verification, Actalis consults the Public Suffix List published at https://publicsuffix.org/.

3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy

Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, the CA shall evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification, according to section 3.2.2.7 of the [BR].

3.2.2.8 CAA Records

As part of the issuance process, the CA shall check for a CAA record for each dNSName in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the certificate to be issued, according to the procedure in RFC 6844 and in section 3.2.2.8 of the [BR]. The CAs shall not issue the certificate unless either (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA Resource Record set or (2) an exception applies. The CA’s CAA identifying domain is “ **actalis.it** ”.

3.2.2.9 Multi‑Perspective Issuance Corroboration

Starting from March 15, 2025, in order to improve protection against Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) attacks or hijacks, Actalis implement Multi‐Perspective Issuance Corroboration – using at least two (2) remote Network Perspectives – in compliance with section 3.2.2.9 of the [BR].

#### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity

For certificates containing Subject Identity Information, if the Applicant is a natural person the CA shall verify theApplicant’s name, Applicant’s address, and the authenticity of the certificate request in compliance with section 3.2.2 of the [BR]. To that aim, Actalis will normally:

- verify the Applicant’s name using a legible copy, which discernibly shows the Applicant’s face, of at   least one currently valid government‐issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, military ID, national ID,     or equivalent document type) and will inspect the copy for any indication of alteration or falsification;
- verify the Applicant’s address using a form of identification that Actalis determines to be reliable, such     as a government ID, utility bill, or bank or credit card statement. Actalis may rely on the same government‐issued ID that was used to verify the Applicant’s name;
- verify the certificate request with the Applicant using a reliable method of communication.

#### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information

The CA does not verify the following Subscriber information:


- Organizational Unit name (except for checking that it’s not misleading);
- information not needed for Subscriber identification purposes;
- email addresses specified in certificate application forms;

In general, the CA does not verify the correctness of any information received from the Applicant that is not intended to be included in security-sensitive fields of the certificate and is not necessary for the issuance and subsequent management (e.g. revocation) of the certificate.

#### 3.2.5 Validation of authority

For certificates containing Subject Identity Information, if the Applicant is an organization the CA shall use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representative’s certificate request, in line with CAB Forum’s [BR], [CSBR] or [EVG} according to certificate type and class.

The CA may use the sources listed in section 3.2.2.1 to verify the Reliable Method of Communication.

Actalis will normally use one the following validation methods:

- By telephone: a CA validation specialist contacts the Applicant by telephone, through the Applicant organization’s general phone number (previously found in a reliable source of information) and asks    confirmation that the certificate request received from Applicant Representative is authentic.
- By on-line authentication: the Applicant Representative sends the certificate request to the CA via a     web site or web service that requires on-line authentication using personal credentials provided to the Applicant Representative after a suitable identification procedure by the CA.
- By certified email: the Applicant specifies the name and contact details of its Representative(s) in an     email message sent to the CA via a certified email service^2 (or an equivalent service), from the Applicant’s certified email address (which must be found in a reliable information source);
- By digital signature: the Applicant sends to the CA a certificate application form, including the name     and contact details of the Applicant Representative(s), as a digitally signed document; the signature     must be a _qualified electronic signature_ (according to EU legislation) and the signer’s certificate must     be valid (not expired nor revoked) and clearly ascribable to the Applicant.
- By formal purchase order: the name and contact details of the Applicant Representative are provided     to the CA in attachment to a formal purchase order issued directly by the Applicant, written on the   Applicant’s headed paper, including complete identifying data of the Applicant and sent to the CA by     the Applicant’s purchasing department.

For EV certificates, the CA shall verify the Name, Title, and Authority (Agency) of Contract Signer and Certificate Approver according to section 11.8 of the [EVGL]. To the aim of this verification, Actalis will normally rely on a suitable representation from the Contract Signer, based on a template provided by Actalis, which must be signed according to section 4.1.2.

#### 3.2.6 Criteria for interoperation

The CA shall disclose all cross certificates that identify the CA as the Subject, provided that the CA arranged for or accepted the establishment of the trust relationship.

(^2) One such service is the Italian “Posta Elettronica Certificata” (PEC).


### 3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION FOR RE-KEY REQUESTS

#### 3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key

Re-keying a certificate may routinely occur in two cases:

- when a Subscriber wishes to replace an existing certificate with a new one (with same or different   details) containing a different key; or
- when a Subscriber wishes to renew a certificate that is about to expire, that is, obtain a new certificate     with the same details of the one that is about to expire; in this case, the CA requires that the new     certificate contains a new key.

In both cases, the CA may request the Subscriber to pass the same identification and authentication procedures used for the initial certificate issuance, depending on the age of the validation data used for the initial certificate issuance (in view of the requirements set forth in [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL]) and on the request channel.

#### 3.3.2 Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation

After a certificate has been revoked, the Subscriber wishing a new certificate must generate a new key pair and follow all the normal identification and authentication procedures as in the initial certificate issuance.

### 3.4 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION FOR REVOCATION REQUESTS

See section 4.9.3.

## 4 CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 CERTIFICATE APPLICATION

#### 4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application

Either the Applicant (i.e., the future Subscriber) or a natural person authorized to request certificates on behalf of the Applicant (i.e., an Applicant Representative) may submit certificate requests, in compliance with the requirements described in par. 3.2.5

Actalis maintains an internal database of all previously revoked certificates and previously rejected certificate requests due to suspected phishing or other fraudulent usage or concerns. Actalis uses this information to identify subsequent suspicious certificate requests.

#### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

The certificate enrollment process includes the following mandatory steps:

- generating a suitable key pair;
- submitting to Actalis a certificate application form;
- delivering to Actalis the public key of the key pair;
- agreeing to and/or signing the applicable Subscriber Agreement;
- paying the applicable fees (depending on certificate class, type, etc.).


All the above steps are the responsibility of the Applicant, except for the Payment which may possibly be made by another entity.

In the case of Code Signing certificates, the generation of the Applicant’s key pair is performed by Actalis upon request, as part of the certificate enrollment process that applies in that case.

The order and the exact way in which these steps are carried out may vary, depending on chosen request channel, but all the steps have to be completed (with the possible exception of the payment which can be deferred, depending on the customer and the amount due, subject to approval by Actalis’ sales department) _before_ the certificate request is taken charge of by the CA.

For DV and OV SSL Server certificates and Code Signing certificates, the following Applicant roles are required, as,defined in the [BR], and enforced within the enrollment process:

- Applicant
- Applicant Representative

For EV SSL Server certificates, the following additional Applicant roles are required, as defined in the [EVGL], and enforced within the enrollment process:

- Certificate Requester
- Certificate Approver
- Contract Signer (the natural person who signs the Subscriber Agreement EV - see below)

The Applicant may authorize one individual to occupy two or more of the above roles, and/or may authorize more than one individual to occupy any of these roles.

The certificate request is normally made through the submission of an online form (web form) on the website of the CA itself or on the website of a Reseller. In special cases where this method cannot be followed, you can submit an off-line application form (e.g., via email) to the CA (available on the CA portal).

Enterprise RAs can request certificates via a specific web-based application hosted by Actalis.

The certificate application always includes the following information:

- type, class, and duration (validity) of the requested certificate;
- for SSL Server certificates, FQDN(s) and/or IP address(es) to be included in the certificate;
- (except for DV SSL Server certificates) value of the proposed Subject DN;
- name and contact details of one or more Technical Contacts.

Only for OV and EV-class certificates, the following information must also be provided:

- details of the Applicant organization (official name, registration number, address, etc.);
- name and contact details of a suitable Organizational Contact.

The certificate application includes, as a mandatory step, the Applicant’s express acceptance of a Subscriber Agreement (also named “Terms and Conditions”) that includes this CPS by reference. Depending on the certificate class and the particular application procedure or channel, the Applicant may agree these terms in different ways, such as:


- by “point and click” on a web form (in conformance to European legislation on distance contracts);
- by expressly confirming acceptance in writing to Actalis (possibly via email);
- by a hand-written signature,
- by a digital signature.

When an actual signature is required, it must be made by a suitably authorized person.

EV Certificate requests must be submitted by an authorized Certificate Requester and approved by a suitable Certificate Approver according to the [EVGL]. The certificate request must be accompanied by a dedicated signed Subscriber Agreement from a suitable Contract Signer according to the [EVGL]. The EV Subscriber Agreement must be signed in one of the following ways:

- by a handwritten signature made before an Actalis representative (who counter-signs as a witness,  after checking the identity of the signatory by examining a valid identity document of the same and     keeping a scan thereof);
- by a handwritten signature with a copy of a valid government‐issued photo ID of the signatory; in this  case, the original handwritten document and the copy of the government ID must be sent to Actalis by     e-mail, from an e-mail address related to a domain under control of the Applicant, then sent to Actalis  by post;
- by a handwritten signature authenticated by a notary or another person whose commission under     applicable law includes authority to authenticate the execution of a signature on a document; (*)
- by a valid _qualified electronic signature_ compliant with European regulations.

(*) In this case, the authenticated copy of the Subscriber Agreement must be sent to the CA in original. The certificate request will not be processed until Actalis has received and verified such original.

Before accepting the Subscriber Agreement, the Applicant or Applicant Representative is supposed to review all aspects of the Actalis’ CA service by reading the documentation published on the CA web site.

The certificate application form and the Subscriber Agreement are available in Italian and English language. Actalis does not commit to support other languages.

The certificate application form must be accompanied or followed by a suitable Certificate Signing Request file (CSR) conformant to section 3.2.1.

## 4.2 CERTIFICATE APPLICATION PROCESSING

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

Upon receipt of a certificate application, all the verifications previously described (see chapter 3 and the previous sections of chapter 4) are performed either automatically, to the extent that is possible and allowed, and/or by a Validation Specialist when necessary or mandatory, in compliance with the [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL] according to certificate type and class.

Depending of the age and applicability of the already available validation data, the CA may re-use previous validations (documents, data, etc.) for additional certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, to the extent that is permitted by the [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL] according to certificate type and class.


The CA also checks that the information contained in the CSR (e.g. Subject DN, FDQNs and/or IP addresses) are consistent with those supplied in the certificate application form and with the type of certificate requested, and rejects the request in case of conflicts or anomalies.

The CA also checks the relevant CAA records (if any) according to paragraph 3.2.2.8 of the [BR]. The domain identifier to be used in the CAA records to authorize the Actalis CA is "actalis.it".
For EV SSL Server certificates, Actalis enforces the principle of Separation of Duties to ensure that no one person can single-handedly validate and authorize the issuance of an EV Certificate, in compliance with section 14.1.3 of the [EVGL]. In particular, the “Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence” (see section 3.2.2.13 of EVGL) is carried out by a different validation specialist than the one(s) who performed the previous validation steps.

Once the essential I&A steps are successfully completed, the CA will normally send to the Applicant Representative, via email, the authentication credentials needed to login to the CA portal, for the possible submission of revocation requests.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

Approval of certificate applications requires the successful completion of all validation steps described so far, in full compliance with all CA policies. However, a few additional checks are performed by Actalis:

- Certificates containing internal names will not be issued.
- Certificates containing a new gTLD under consideration by ICANN will not be issued.
- Certificates for domains with “.onion” in their right-most label will not be issued.
- Actalis will reject certificate requests for domains that, at the time of issuance, are reported as risky     (e.g. because of phishing or malware) by widely used domain reputation services.
- Actalis maintains a list of high-profile domains and will block the issuance of certificates containing any    of those domains, in order to mitigate the associated risks. Before such requests can be approved, the     Applicant will be required to provide extra information to corroborate its right to use such domain(s).

### 4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications

No stipulation.

## 4.3 CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE

### 4.3.1 CA actions during certificate issuance

If the previous steps (see section 4.2) are completed successfully, the CA system:

- checks that the CSR is well-formed and does not contain unexpected data;
- checks that the CSR is cryptographically valid according to section 3.2.1;
- checks that the key found in the CSR is not a known “weak key” (see CVE- 2008 - 0166);
- performs a linting of _tbsCertificate,_ using linters broadly adopted by the industry, in order to minimize the risk of incorrect issuance;
- checks the relevant CAA Records (if any) according to section 3.2.2.8 of the [BR].

If all the above checks are successful, the CA generates the certificate, stores it into its database, and eventually sends to the Applicant an e-mail containing at least:


- the Subscriber certificate (or a link to it);
- the certificate of the Issuing CA (or a link to it).

All of the above operations are performed automatically for Subscriber certificates, normally.

All SSL Server certificates issued after 30 April 2018 MUST be compliant with Certificate Transparency requirements according to [CT]. When an SSL Server certificate is to be issued, a precertificate is first generated and registered in a number of CT-logs according to Chromium CT Policy. Each CT-log returns a signed certificate timestamp (SCT) as a proof of inclusion. Then, the final certificate is generated wherein the SCTs are embedded as an extension (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.2).

In case of a Subordinate CA certificate, however, the certificate issuance requires a suitably authorized individual (i.e., the CA system operator, system officer, or PKI administrator) to deliberately issue a direct command in order for the Root CA to perform the certificate signing operation.

### 4.3.2 Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate

The Subscriber will normally be notified via email of the successful issuance of the certificate, either by the CA directly or by an RA and/or Reseller where applicable, provided that the email address supplied to the CA for that purpose by the Applicant Representative or Certificate Requester is valid.

## 4.4 CERTIFICATE ACCEPTANCE

### 4.4.1 Conduct constituting certificate acceptance

The CA intends the certificate as accepted after 30 days from the date of delivery, as attested by the date of the electronic mail message sent to the Subscriber, barring any notice to the contrary from the Subscriber.

Public use of the certificate (i.e., its installation on a website with public access, publication on a public website of executable code signed by that certificate), even if temporary, shall in any case imply acceptance of the certificate by the Subscriber.

In the event that the certificate is issued with incorrect information in it due to incorrect completion of the application form by the requestor, the certificate must nonetheless be paid for.

### 4.4.2 Publication of the certificate by the CA

As regards Root CA and Subordinate CA certificates, see paragraph 2.2
No stipulation as regards end entity certificates.

### 4.4.3 Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

For all new SSL Server certificates, the CA submits the pre-certificate to at least two different Certificate Transparency (CT) logs according to RFC6962.

## 4.5 KEY PAIR AND CERTIFICATE USAGE

### 4.5.1 Subscriber private key and certificate usage

The Subscriber shall use the private key:


- (Code Signing certificates) to digitally sign their own executable code (e.g., PE files, Java applets, dynamic libraries, etc.) and/or code for which the Subscriber is responsible;
- (SSL Server certificates) to activate the TLS/SSL protocol on their own servers, thereby allowing TLS server authentication and session encryption of the transactions with clients.

### 4.5.2 Relying party public key and certificate usage

The relying parties shall use the certificate to:

- (Code Signing certificates) verify the integrity and origin of the executable code;
- (SSL Server certificates) verify the identity of a server and (depending on certificate class) the organization which controls the server, as well as to exchange the “session key” safely with the server.

See also paragraph 1.4.

## 4.6 CERTIFICATE RENEWAL

Renewal of a certificate means the issuing of a new certificate containing the same Subject identifying information (according to the certificate class) and the same domains and IP addresses (according to the type of certificate) that are found in a certificate already issued and not yet expired or revoked.

The CA makes a reasonable effort to inform the Subscriber about the forthcoming expiration of their certificates, by periodically sending emails to the Technical Contact. The warning emails are sent, normally, starting from 30 days before the expiry of the certificate.

### 4.6.1 Circumstance for certificate renewal

Same as described in par. 4.1.1.

### 4.6.2 Who may request renewal

Same as described in par. 4.1.2.

### 4.6.3 Processing certificate renewal requests

Same as described in par. 4.1.3.

### 4.6.4 Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber

Same as described in par. 4.1.4.

### 4.6.5 Conduct constituting acceptance of a renewal certificate

Same as described in par. 4.1.5.

### 4.6.6 Publication of the renewal certificate by the CA

Same as described in par. 4.1.6.

### 4.6.7 Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

Same as described in par. 4.1.7.


## 4.7 CERTIFICATE RE-KEY

Certificate re-keying implies the issuance of a new certificate, with a new public key and a new serial number, but with the same Subject information found in the current certificate, provided this latter is not expired or revoked (otherwise, the normal first-issuance procedures are followed).

#### 4.7.1 Circumstance for certificate re-key

Key regeneration is a mandatory step if certificate renewal is required, but may also be required following the compromise of the current key or for other reasons at the discretion of the CA.

### 4.7.2 Who may request certification of a new public key

Certificate re-keying may be requested by the Subscriber, or by an RA, or by the CA, depending on circumstances.

### 4.7.3 Processing certificate re-key requests

Normally, the procedure for processing a key regeneration request is the same as in the new certificate issuance case. If the evidences previously collected during the I&A phase (see section 3.2) are still valid, the CA can process the request without necessarily redoing I&A; in this case, an authenticated request by the Subscriber is sufficient.

### 4.7.4 Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber

Same as described in par. 4. 3. 2.

### 4.7.5 Conduct constituting acceptance of a re-keyed certificate

Same as described in par. 4. 4. 1.

### 4.7.6 Publication of the re-keyed certificate by the CA

Same as described in par. 4. 4. 2.

### 4.7.7 Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

Same as described in par. 4. 4. 3.

## 4.8 CERTIFICATE MODIFICATION

Certificate modification implies issuing a new certificate to the same Subscriber, with the same or a different public key, but with different identification information (e.g. parts of Subject or SubjectAlternativeNames) than are found in the old certificate.

### 4.8.1 Circumstance for certificate modification

When the old certificate contains incorrect information due to errors committed by the CA or RA, that incorrect certificate will be revoked and a correct one will be issued without additional charges for the customer.

When the old certificate contains incorrect information due to errors committed by the Applicant (e.g. incorrect inputs in one or more fields of the request form), that incorrect certificate will be revoked and the Subscriber may request a new certificate.

### 4.8.2 Who may request certificate modification

Certificate modification may be requested by the Subscriber, or by an RA, or by the CA, depending on the case.


### 4.8.3 Processing certificate modification requests

Normally, the procedure for modifying a certificate is the same as for issuing a new certificate. Depending on the case, a new I&A (see Section 3.2) may be necessary, either complete or partial.

### 4.8.4 Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber

Same as described in par. 4. 3. 2.

### 4.8.5 Conduct constituting acceptance of modified certificate

Same as described in par. 4. 4. 1.

### 4.8.6 Publication of the modified certificate by the CA

Same as described in par. 4.4.2.

### 4.8.7 Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

Same as described in par. 4.4.3.

## 4.9 CERTIFICATE SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION

The suspension of the certificate determines a temporary suspension of the validity of a certificate, starting from a given moment in time (date/time). Once a certificate has been suspended, it can be re-activated at any time.
Suspension is not supported for certificates issued under this CPS.

Revocation determines the premature termination of the validity of a certificate, starting from a given moment in time (date/time). Revocation of a certificate is irreversible.

Implementation of revocation consists in the generation and publication of a new CRL (Certificate Revocation List) that includes the serial number of the revoked certificate, and update of the OCSP responder database (see section 4.10 for more details on certificate status services).

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for revocation

4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate

The CA shall revoke a certificate **within 24 hours** if one or more of the following events occurs:

- the Subscriber requests in writing that the CA revoke the certificate;
- the Subscriber notifies the CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not     retroactively grant authorization;
- the CA obtains evidence that the Subscriber’s private key (corresponding to the public key in the    certificate) has suffered a key compromise;
- the CA is made aware that the domain control validation for any of the FQDNs and/or IPs contained in     the certificate should not be relied upon.

The CA shall revoke a certificate **within 5 days** if one or more of the following events occurs:

- the certificate no longer complies with the requirements of Sections 6.1.5 and 6.1.6 of the [BR] or with   others applicable policies and/or standards;
- the CA is made aware that the certificate was misused (e.g., for unlawful purposes);
- the CA is made aware that the Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under     the Terms & Conditions of the service and/or this CPS;
- the CA is made aware that use of a FQDN or IP address in the certificate is no longer legally permitted   (e.g., national or international court or arbitrator has revoked a domain name registrant’s right to use     the domain name or applied specific sanctions to registrant, the domain name registrant has failed to     renew the domain name, etc.);
- the CA is made aware that a wildcard certificate has been used to authenticate a fraudulently misleading subordinate FQDN;
- the CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the certificate;
- the CA is made aware that the certificate has any non-compliance with this CPS and/or with the [BR] requirements and/or the [EVGL] guidelines (where applicable), regardless of the impact of such non-compliance on the security and/or the correct working of the certificate;
- the CA determines that any of the information appearing in the certificate is inaccurate or misleading  (e.g., the Subscriber organization no longer exists, or is indicated ambiguously in the certificate);
- the CA’s right to issue certificates under the [BR] expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has     made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP repository;
- the CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's private key    to compromise, or methods have been developed that can easily calculate it based on the public key, or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the private key was flawed;
- compromise of the private key of the subordinate CA used for issuing the certificate;
- breach of contract by the client (e.g., failure to pay for the certificate);
- a court order to revoke the certificate.

If an EV certificate is requested, by means of a handwritten signature, the CA will revoke the certificate for the following circumstances:

- failure to send, within 30 days from the issue of the certificate, the original documentation together with the copy of the government ID;
- incorrectness of the documentation compared to the original copy sent in advance by e-mail.

Before revoking a certificate, the CA will make a reasonable effort to warn to the affected Subscriber of the imminent revocation, compatibly with the maximum revocation times indicated above. However, the CA shall immediately revoke the certificate _without a prior notice_ in the following cases:

- the certificate is being used for any kind of criminal activity (e.g., "phishing" attacks, "man-in-the-middle" attacks, malware distribution, etc.);
- the certificate was erroneously issued with CA = TRUE in its KeyUsage extension.

4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate

Actalis shall meet the requirements set forth in section 4.9.1.2 of the [BR].

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

Revocation can be requested by (depending on circumstances):

- the Subscriber;
- the issuing Certificate Authority;
- the Registration Authority;
- a court of law.

Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports (in accordance with the circumstances described in Section 4.9.1 and in the manner described in Section 1.5.2.) informing the issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the certificate.

Under certain circumstances the Subscriber _must_ request revocation of its certificate (see §9.6.3).

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

Requests for revocation can be submitted directly to the CA, through the CA portal. In the event that the certificate was provided through a reseller or through an RA, revocation of the certificate may also be requested through the reseller or RA. In any case, before revocation of a certificate can be requested, it is necessary to authenticate to the relevant web site / service with the credentials that were provided to the Subscriber for that purpose at the time of certificate issuance.

As an alternative, it is possible to fill out a revocation request form (downloadable from the Actalis’ web site), signed by the Subscriber. The signed form must then be sent directly to the CA (e.g., via ordinary mail, or rather e-mail). Before carrying out the revocation, the CA will check that the request is authentic. Revocation requests submitted to the CA in this way are handled on working days only.

For revocation requests submitted on-line, certificates shall be revoked within 24 hours.

Regardless of whom requested the certificate revocation, the CA shall normally inform the Subscriber about the effected revocation via an e-mail message sent to the “technical contact” specified in the application form.

In cases provided for by applicable standards, policies, CAB Forum’s requirements, and Root CA Programs, Ac-talis may initiate procedures for the mass revocation of certificates to protect the security and reliability of the PKI. For this purpose, Actalis maintains a comprehensive and actionable procedure for such scenarios, perform-ing annual tests with a view to continuously improving its internal procedures.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

There is no grace period associated with certificate revocation requests. The Subscriber is expected to request revocation of its certificate as soon as circumstances requiring revocation (see §4.9.1) are confirmed.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

Properly authenticated revocation requests received from Subscribers are processed within 24 hours provided that the request is made with the expected on-line procedure (see section 4.9.3).

In case of certificate problem reports that may require revocation (as described at 1.5.2), investigation on the alleged problem will begin within 24 hours of receiving the problem report. Once decided that certificate revocation is warranted, it will be carried out within 24 hours.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

See section 9.6.4.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

See paragraph 4.10.1.


### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs

CRLs are published right after having been generated. The latency between generation time and publication time may depend on the load of the CA’s processing systems; it is typically a few minutes and does not exceed 60 minutes.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

The CA shall support an OCSP capability using the GET method for all certificates and pre-certificates that have been allocated serial. The OCSP service is available from 15 minutes after the serial assignment.

Except for CAs that are technically constrained in line with section 7.1.5, the CA’s OCSP responders shall not respond with a "good" status when queried about a certificate or pre-certificates that has not been assigned a serial.

The CA shall update the information provided via OCSP in compliance with the [BR] and [CSBR].

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

See sections 4.10 and 7.3.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

Actalis allows for OCSP stapling.

#### 4.9.12 Special requirements related to key compromise

No particular requirement in case of key compromise detected by the Subscriber. In this case, the Subscriber is supposed to promptly request Actalis to revoke their certificate (see section 9.6.3).

Subjects _other_ than the Subscriber can report the compromise of the key of an Actalis certificate (not expired and not revoked) using one of the following methods to demonstrate that they possess or control the private key in question:

- Create a text file containing the phrase “This key is compromised” (or a similar phrase), then sign the file with the private key that you want to report as compromised and send the signed file to Actalis (§).
- Create, with the private key that you want to report as compromised, a CSR that includes the text “This key is compromised” (or a similar phrase) in the commonName, then send the CSR to Actalis (§).
- Send to Actalis (§) the private key that you want to report as compromised. However, this method is     _not recommended for safety reasons_.
- Send to Actalis (§) references to sources of information on vulnerabilities and/or security incidents that allow to verify the compromise.

(§) Send to cert-problem@actalis.it specifying "Key compromise" as the subject.

Actalis may, at its discretion, also allow other methods to demonstrate possession or control of a private key.

#### 4.9.13 Circumstances for suspension

Not applicable.


#### 4.9.14 Who can request suspension

Not applicable.

#### 4.9.15 Procedure for suspension request

Not applicable.

#### 4.9.16 Limits on suspension period

Not applicable.


### 4.10 CERTIFICATE STATUS SERVICES

In general, the status of certificates (active or revoked) is made available to all interested parties via:

- the publication of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL);
- the provision of an OCSP (On-line Certificate Status Protocol) service.

#### 4.10.1 Operational characteristics

The CRL can be accessed:

- via HTTP protocol according to [RFC2616]

The addresses (URLs) of the CRL are inserted in the _CRLDistributionPoints_ extension of the certificate.

The CRL is re-generated and re-published:

- at least every 6 hours, even in the absence of new revocations;
- following each new revocation.

The address (URL) of the OCSP responder is inserted in the _AuthorityInformationAccess_ certificate extension.

The CRL and OCSP services can be freely accessed by anyone.

The ARL, namely the list of revoked SubCA certificates, is re-generated and re-published:

- at least every 3 months, even in the absence of new revocations;
- following each new revocation. 

Revocation entries in CRLs and OCSP responses shall not be removed until after the expiry date of the revoked certificates.

#### 4.10.2 Service availability

Access to the CRL and OCSP service shall be continuously available (24 x 7), except in the case of system faults or other unexpected events. See also section 17.1.

For both CRL and OCSP, the response time shall be ten seconds or less under normal operating conditions.

#### 4.10.3 Optional features

No stipulation.

### 4.11 END OF SUBSCRIPTION

The contract between the CA and the Subscriber ends when the Subscriber’s certificate expires or is revoked, whichever comes first.

### 4.12 KEY ESCROW AND RECOVERY

#### 4.12.1 Key escrow and recovery policy and practices

Not applicable.


#### 4.12.2 Session key encapsulation and recovery policy and practices

Not applicable.

## 5 FACILITY, MANAGEMENT, AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS

For the management of its CA infrastructure, Actalis makes use of the data center services provided by its holding company, Aruba S.p.A., who takes responsibility for the housing, Internet connectivity, physical and network security of all Actalis’ systems. The data center service provided is ISO/IEC 27001 certified.

### 5.1 PHYSICAL CONTROLS

#### 5.1.1 Site location and construction

All computer systems used for the provision of Actalis’ CA services are housed in highly secure data centers owned and managed by the Actalis’ holding company, Aruba S.p.A. In particular, Actalis maintains at least two full PKI infrastructures at separate locations, for redundancy, plus a third one at a distant location (> 300 km), for disaster recovery purposes. All these data centers are located on the Italian territory.

#### 5.1.2 Physical access

At all the CA facilities, the following controls are in place:

- physical **access control system** , so that access to the facility is possible only to those who need, upon registration at the reception, and that access to the technical rooms is allowed only to authorized employees;
- **passive anti-intrusion systems** such as grids, bulletproof glass, armored doors, motorized gates;
- **active anti-intrusion systems** such as CCTV and VMD.

#### 5.1.3 Power and air conditioning

All data centers hosting Actalis’ CA services are equipped with:

- fully redundant power supply systems, to guarantee the continuity of electric power supply in every predictable condition;
- ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) to ensure optimal climatic conditions for the regular operation of servers hosted in the data center.

#### 5.1.4 Water exposures

All data centers hosting Actalis’ CA services are equipped with flood detection and protection systems.

#### 5.1.5 Fire prevention and protection

All the data centers hosting Actalis’ CA services are equipped with fire detection and suppression systems compliant with the applicable laws and standards; fire detectors are also present on all floors of the building. For the details of specific data centers, see par. 5.1.1.

#### 5.1.6 Media storage

On the topic of media storage, the procedures set by Actalis’ ISMS apply.

#### 5.1.7 Waste disposal

On the subject of waste disposal, the CA applies the provisions of current regulations.


#### 5.1.8 Off-site backup

Backups are stored at a different site than that of data origin, thus ensuring the possibility of restoration in any foreseeable condition.

### 5.2 PROCEDURAL CONTROLS

Actalis maintains a Security Plan, including a Risk Assessment, which analyses the CA assets, the threats they are exposed to, and describes the various technical, physical and procedural controls deployed so to adequately mitigate the risks. The risk assessment is reviewed at least yearly.

#### 5.2.1 Trusted roles

Actalis has defined and formally assigned the following trusted roles within the CA service regulated by this CPS:

- Security Officer: responsible for implementation and management of security procedures;
- System Administrator: responsible for installation, configuration and maintenance of CA systems;
- System Operator: responsible for the day-to-day operation of CA systems;
- System Auditor: responsible for checking the reviewing record archives and audit logs;
- Internal Auditor: responsible for performing self-audits (see section 8.7) and other assessments;
- Validation Specialist: responsible for performing the information verification duties specified by this CPS (in particular, those described in section 3);
- Registration & Revocation Officer: responsible for verifying the information needed to issue certificates     and approving certificate requests; also responsible for certificate status changes (e.g. revocations).

Some persons may hold multiple roles provided that this does not prejudice the security and trustworthiness of the PKI and is not prohibited by applicable regulations and standards.

Trusted roles are appointed by senior management. A list of personnel appointed to trusted roles is maintained and reviewed annually, and made available to auditors.

#### 5.2.2 Number of persons required per task

Management of the CA private keys (key generation, backup, restore, deletion, etc.) requires at least two persons in trusted roles ("dual control") and must take place in a physically protected environment.

Issuance of EV certificates shall require the participation of at least two validation specialists.

#### 5.2.3 Identification and authentication for each role

All the trusted roles listed in par. 5.2.1 and, in general, all the Actalis staff use appropriate identification and authentication systems for accessing Actalis’ computer systems.

In particular, with regard to the physical access to data rooms and cabinets that contain the CA systems, identification and authentication takes place by means of restricted access.

As regards the logical access to the CA systems, identification is based on the account name and relative password or through a two-factor authentication system where necessary. In particular, access to any account that allows direct issuance of certificates requires strong authentication (multi-factor).


#### 5.2.4 Roles requiring separation of duties

Persons holding any of the trusted roles listed in par. 5.2.1 cannot have other roles within the CA services, except for Validation Specialists and Registration & Revocation Officers. See also section 5.2.2

### 5.3 PERSONNEL CONTROLS

#### 5.3.1 Qualifications, experience, and clearance requirements

Actalis ensures that the personnel assigned to its CA services are adequately competent for the tasks assigned to them, based on appropriate education, training, skills, and experience, and that they are free from conflicts of interest that may compromise the necessary impartiality and respect of the procedures. In particular, with reference to the trusted roles, the required characteristics and skills are described in the "job description" company document.

In the case of new recruitments, Actalis always reserves the right to assess what type of training is necessary in relation to the tasks to be assigned, the existing qualifications and experience, and provides where necessary for the inclusion of the resource in a training plan.

#### 5.3.2 Background check procedures

For the definition of the shortlist of candidates, both for technical and administrative areas, Actalis uses both the curricula sent directly to it through the appropriate channels (e.g. website) and those provided by external recruiters. For each candidate, the accuracy of the information contained in the CV (e.g. education, masters, specific training courses, etc.) is verified. External recruiters contracted by Actalis also have the obligation to request references, for each potential candidate, before submitting their CVs to Actalis. Furthermore, all candidates, once the selection phase is completed, must provide their certificate of good conduct (extract from the judicial record) or an equivalent declaration to the Human Resources office.

#### 5.3.3 Training requirements

The staff in charge of the CA services is adequately trained for the tasks that they perform. Actalis provides staff with initial training at the time of recruitment, including courses held by external teachers when deemed necessary, and training on the job.

The staff involved in the verification of information (Validation Specialists) are trained on at least the following topics: Public Key Infrastructures (PKI), identification and authentication policies and procedures, common threats to information verification procedures, and CAB Forum Requirements [BR] and Guidelines [EVGL]. The records of this training, which is provided at least yearly, are kept and made available to the auditors on request.

#### 5.3.4 Retraining frequency and requirements

For all personnel working in the CA service, the need for new training is assessed at least once per year (or in advance, in case new developments/services), so as to ensure that all personnel are always able to perform their tasks satisfactorily and competently. Furthermore, training on information security matters is held annually for all staff.

#### 5.3.5 Job rotation frequency and sequence

No stipulation.


#### 5.3.6 Sanctions for unauthorized actions

In the case of unauthorized actions and/or violations of company (or Group) policy and/or procedures, Actalis reserves the right to activate the disciplinary procedure provided for in the employment contract, after having assessed the nature and the severity of the violation and its impact on company operations, whether it was the first occurrence, whether the employee had been adequately trained, etc.

#### 5.3.7 Independent contractor requirements

Any independent contractor or Delegated Third Party’s personnel involved in the issuance of Certificates shall be fully subject to this CPS, including training and skills requirements (see section 5.3.3), sanctions (see section 5.3.6), document retention and event logging requirements (see section 5.4.1).

Non-employees (e.g. consultants) are required to sign a confidentiality agreement (NDA) before starting collaboration with Actalis and possibly accessing confidential data.

#### 5.3.8 Documentation supplied to personnel

Personnel in trusted roles are provided with the documentation necessary to perform their duties, depending on their role (see section 5.2.1). In particular, Validation Specialists are provided with this CPS, CAB Forum’s Baseline Requirements and EV Guidelines, and detailed instructions on how to properly perform the identification and authentication activities and issue certificates, plus the manuals of the CA/RA applications they use.

### 5.4 AUDIT LOGGING PROCEDURES

#### 5.4.1 Types of events recorded

The CA and any Delegated Third Parties shall record all the details related to certificate requests, issuances, and subsequent management (e.g. revocation), and make these records available to the CA auditors. For each event, information shall be recorded about event type, date and time of occurrence, the associated data (depending on event type), the personnel involved (if applicable), and possibly other information depending on event type.

At least the following events shall be logged, in line with section 5.4.1 of the [BR]:

- CA key lifecycle management events;
- CA and Subscriber certificate life cycle management events;
- Security events (e.g. accesses to PKI systems, PKI and security system actions performed, security profile changes, entries to and exits from the CA facility, relevant activities on routers and firewalls,     etc.).

#### 5.4.2 Frequency of processing log

The relevant events are collected by the systems that generate them and are transmitted to the centralized log management system. On the log management system, events are automatically classified and stored locally in order to allow them to be consulted. On a daily basis, local data are copied to the long-term storage system (see Section 5.4.4).

#### 5.4.3 Retention period for audit log

The CA shall retain audit logs for at least 10 years.


#### 5.4.4 Protection of audit log

Audit logs are periodically stored on a remote long-term archival system based on WORM-type (Write-Once, Read Many) or equivalent technology. The “live” copy of the audit log is protected from tampering by multiple security measures.

#### 5.4.5 Audit log backup procedures

The storage where the audit log is archived (see section 5.4.4) is replicated on two data centers hosted in separate facilities.

#### 5.4.6 Audit collection system (internal vs. external)

No stipulation.

#### 5.4.7 Notification to event-causing subject

No stipulation.

#### 5.4.8 Vulnerability assessments

Audit logs are periodically examined for anomalies by personnel in trusted roles. Anomalies indicating possible security breaches are reported and investigated. Security incidents are handled according to section 5.7.1.

Vulnerability assessments of the CA networks and systems are done at least annually by qualified third parties. See also section 6.7.

A comprehensive a risk assessment is conducted at least annually (see also section 5.2).

### 5.5 RECORDS ARCHIVAL

#### 5.5.1 Types of records archived

The CA keeps at least the following information related to the request, issuance and revocation of certificates:

- certificate requests, including CSRs;
- details of applicants and applicant representatives;
- any further documentation supplied by applicants;
- verifications performed by the CA and the results thereof;
- certificate revocation requests.

#### 5.5.2 Retention period for archive

Archived records are kept for at least 10 years past the certificates’ expiration or revocation dates.

#### 5.5.3 Protection of archive

Archives are protected from unauthorized modification or destruction by strong security controls. To this end, a document preservation service is used complying with the Italian regulations (Legislative Decree No. 82/2005: “Codice dell’Amministrazione Digitale” and subsequent amendments and additions) and accredited by AgID.

#### 5.5.4 Archive backup procedures

Archives are backed up by the preservation system referred to in paragraph 5.5.3.

#### 5.5.5 Requirements for time-stamping of records

All archived records are time-stamped at the date and time of creation or occurrence, with a date and time reference obtained from a trusted time source (see section 6.8).

#### 5.5.6 Archive collection system (internal or external)

No stipulation.

#### 5.5.7 Procedures to obtain and verify archive information

The retention system referred to in paragraph 5.5.3 allows searching for archived information on the basis of the associated metadata, as well as its recovery and the verification of its integrity.

### 5.6 KEY CHANGEOVER

#### 5.6.1 Root CA

No stipulation.

#### 5.6.2 Subordinate CA

At least 2 years before the end of the validity of the current certification key (Subordinate CA key), a new keypair will be generated and the corresponding certificate will be made available to Subscribers and Relying Parties as described in section 6.1. 4. From that moment on, Subscriber certificates and related CRLs will be signed with the new Sub CA key.

### 5.7 COMPROMISE AND DISASTER RECOVERY

#### 5.7.1 Incident and compromise handling procedures

The Actalis’ Information Security Management System (ISMS), compliant with ISO/IEC 27001, also includes incident and compromise handling procedures. The management of an information security incident is handled by following a multi-stage procedure coordinated by an internal committee (Committee for Security and Crisis Management, later on "Committee") composed of figures of various responsibilities and members of the senior management. The process is articulated into several phases described below:

- Detection: phase in which any person (employee, collaborator or any interested party) who detects a possible incident communicates it to the Committee. The Committee ensures that the report is as detailed as possible and that those who have encountered the problem do not take any action autonomously.
- Identification and analysis: the Committee takes charge of the report and assesses whether it is actually a security incident. If so, it evaluates its severity and proceeds with the following phases.    Otherwise, it just closes the incident.
- Containment: in this phase, the harmful effects caused by the incident are contained as much as pos    sible, in order to prevent them from spreading to other areas of the organization.
- Collection of evidence: phase in which the evidence is sought for and collected in order to attach it to the documentation of the incident in case of possible legal consequences or for the need to proceed with more in-depth investigations. All the evidences are collected following guidelines which aim to guarantee a correct and reliable collection.
- Removal and Recovery: phase in which the cause of the damage is removed and the systems affected     are reactivated, through the recovery procedures, allowing the systems and users to return to work.

- Incident closure and Notification: once the recovery phase is over, the incident is closed. In this phase, the incident closure is notified to the involved managers.

Disaster management is regulated by the Actalis’ Business Continuity Plan (BCP) which covers all items listed in paragraph 5.7.1 of the [BR]. See also section 5.1.

#### 5.7.2 Computing resources, software, and/or data are corrupted

Actalis implements a Business Continuity Plan for the CA service in order to ensure that the corruption or loss of one or more computers cannot cause any disruption to the CA platform. In particular, all the critical components of the system are redundant both locally, in the single data center, and between the primary and secondary data centers. Actalis also implements specific backup plans to guarantee that there is no loss of software and/or data.

#### 5.7.3 Entity private key compromise procedures

The CA's private key is the single most critical resource of the CA; as such, it is protected by a set of multi-layered security measures, as other critical CA resources. In case of compromise (loss of confidentiality) of the CA key, after assessment of the incident, Actalis will execute the following plan (not necessarily in this order):

- notify the national supervisory body (AgID);
- notify the conformity assessment body (CAB);
- publish a well-visible information note on the CA website;
- notify the Application Software Suppliers with whom Actalis has a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place;
- notify any Delegated Third Parties (DTPs) and other interested parties to the extent possible;
- revoke of all certificates that were issued with the compromised key.

Finally, unless the CA is to be terminated, a new CA key pair will be generated and the new CA public key will be disseminated as described in section 6.1.4.

#### 5.7.4 Business continuity capabilities after a disaster

Actalis are deployed in two geographically distant facilities (see section 5.1), each of which is capable of operatingthe CA systems independently. In the event that a disaster entirely disables one facility, Actalis’ CA operations will fail over to another facility. See also section 5.7.1.

### 5.8 CA OR RA TERMINATION

The activities that will be carried out if Actalis decides, for any reason, to cease its certification service are described below.

Before the actual termination:

- at least 60 days before the scheduled termination date, an information note will be sent to all customers of the CA service (and other services that include the CA services), as well as to the supervisory body (AgID), the conformity assessment body (CAB), and other subjects with whom the CA has stipulated agreements in this regard;
- with a minimum notice of 60 days, an informative note will be published on the CA website, in order to make the information available also to Relying Parties;

- with a minimum notice of 60 days, the CA will send a notice to all possible sub-contractors and Delegated Third Parties (RAs), informing them that at the end of the deadline they will no longer be authorized to perform activities related to the certificate issuance service;
- the responsibility for the preservation of evidences (certificate requests, event log, etc.) will be trans    ferred to another reliable subject that can guarantee preservation for an adequate time.

## 6 TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

### 6.1 KEY PAIR GENERATION AND INSTALLATION

#### 6.1.1 Key pair generation

6.1.1.1 CA key pair generation

Generation of all CA key pairs (Root CAs and subordinate CAs) takes place in a physically secured environment, following a documented procedure that requires the joint intervention of two different people in Trusted Roles under the principles of “ _dual control_ ” and “ _split-knowledge_ ”. All CA key pairs are generated inside HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) meeting the requirements of section 6.2.1. Execution of the procedure is witnessed by an internal auditor and by an independent qualified auditor; the activity is recorded in a report which is archived on the liability of the Director of Certification Services.

6.1.1.2 RA key pair generation

No stipulation.

6.1.1.3 Subscriber key pair generation

For SSL certificates, the Subscriber’s key pairs shall be generated by the Subscriber itself.

The CA shall reject a certificate request for a public key that does not meet the requirements set forth in sections 6.1.5 and 6.1.6 or if it is a known weak key (such as a “Debian weak key”, see [http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys)](http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys))

For Code Signing certificates, the Subscriber’s Private Keys MUST be generated, stored, and used in compliance with the requirements in section 6.2.7.

#### 6.1.2 Private Key delivery to subscriber

See paragraph 6.1.1.3.

#### 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer

The Applicant must submit its public key to the issuing CA in the form of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) conforming to the PKCS#10 standard [RFC2314].


#### 6.1.4 CA public key delivery to relying parties

Root CA public keys are distributed at least in these ways:

- by publication in the CA repository (in the form of self-signed certificates);
- by inclusion in the lists of trusted Root CAs (“root stores”) managed and distributed by software suppliers, such as operating system and/or browser vendors;
- via the Trust-service Status List (TSL) that is published on the AgID website.

Subordinate CA (i.e. issuing CA) public keys, in the form of certificates signed by the Root CA, are provided to Subscribers, together with the Subscriber certificate, and are published in the CA repository.

#### 6.1.5 Key sizes

Root CAs shall use an RSA key pair with a module size of 4096 bits or an ECDSA key pair with a size of 384 bits.

Subordinate CAs (i.e. issuing CAs) shall use an RSA key pair with a module size of at least 2048 bits or ECSDA key pair with at least of 256 bits.

Subscriber keys shall be either:

- RSA keys with a module size of at least 2048 bits (up to 4096),
- or ECC keys of type NIST P- 256 or P- 384.

Effective from June 1, 2021, RSA keys used for Code Signing shall have a module size of at least 3072 bits.

#### 6.1.6 Public key parameters generation and quality checking

The CA shall confirm that public keys meet the requirements set forth in section 6.1.6 of the [BR].

#### 6.1.7 Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field)

Root CA private keys MUST NOT be used to sign Certificates except in the cases listed in §6.1.7 of the [BR]

See also section 7.

### 6.2 PRIVATE KEY PROTECTION AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE ENGINEERING CONTROLS

#### 6.2.1 Cryptographic module standards and controls

All CA private keys (both Root CAs and issuing CAs) shall be generated, stored and used only in HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) pos¬sessing a security evaluation according to FIPS PUB 140-2 Level 3 (or higher), FIPS PUB 140-3 Level 3 (or higher) and/or Common Criteria (namely ISO/IEC 15408) at EAL 4 or higher.

#### 6.2.2 Private Key (n out of m) multi-person control

See section 5.2.2.

#### 6.2.3 Private Key escrow

Actalis does not escrow its CA private keys to any third parties nor does it provide such a service for Subscriber keys.


#### 6.2.4 Private Key backup

For guaranteeing continuity of service, Actalis keeps encrypted backup copies of its CA keys on removable media.
The backup copy is kept in a safe place that is different from the location of the operational copy. Backup and restore procedures require the joint intervention of at least two people (“dual control”) in trusted roles.

#### 6.2.5 Private Key archival

No stipulation beyond what is provided for in the [BR].

#### 6.2.6 Private Key transfer into or from a cryptographic module

When CA private keys are transferred between HSMs (e.g., for redundancy or backup purposes) they are encrypted prior to leaving HSMs and unwrapped only inside destination HSMs. CA private keys never exist in plain text form outside of HSMs. Actalis does not generate CA keys for external subordinate CAs.

#### 6.2.7 Private Key storage on cryptographic module

6.2.7.1 Private key storage for CA keys

Private Keys corresponding to CA Keys MUST be stored in accordance with [BR] section 6.2.7.

6.2.7.2 Private key storage for Timestamp Authorities

Actalis’ Timestamp Authority protects its signing keys according to [CSBR] section 6.2.7.

6.2.7.3 Private key storage for Signing Services

The Actalis’ Code Signing Service ensures that Subscribers’ Private Keys are generated, stored, and used in a secure environment that meets the requirements of [CSBR] section 6.2.7.

6.2.7.4 Subscriber Private Key protection and verification

For Private Keys corresponding to **SSL certificates** , the requirements in [BR] section 6.2 are applied.

For Private Keys corresponding to **Code Signing certificates** , the following requirements are applied.

Actalis normally issues Code Signing certificates only for private keys generated, stored and used through the **Actalis’ Code Signing Service** (see also section 6.2.7.3).

At its own discretion, Actalis may in some circumstances issue Code Signing certificates on personal crypto-graphic devices (e.g., smartcards or similar) that comply at least with FIPS PUB 140 Level 3 (or higher), FIPS PUB 140-3 Level 3 (or higher), and/or Common Criteria EAL 4 or higher, or equivalent security criteria.

#### 6.2.8 Method of activating private key

CA private keys are only activated by authorized persons, using the mechanisms provided by the HSM manufacturer. Activation data and devices are protected from loss or disclosure to unauthorized people.

Subscribers are responsible for protecting their private keys. Subscribers are supposed to use a strong password or an equivalent authentication method to prevent unauthorized access or use of their private keys.


#### 6.2.9 Method of deactivating private key

CA private keys are de-activated by authorized persons, using the mechanisms provided by the HSM manufacturer.

#### 6.2.10 Method of destroying private key

CA private keys shall be destroyed when they are no longer needed. CA keys are only destroyed by authorized persons in trusted roles, using the mechanisms provided by the HSM manufacturer.

Subscribers shall securely destroy their private keys when they are no longer needed (e.g. when the corresponding certificates expire or are revoked) by suitable methods depending on the type of media where the private keys are stored (e.g. storage media or HSMs).

#### 6.2.11 Cryptographic Module Rating

See section 6.2.1.

### 6.3 OTHER ASPECTS OF KEY PAIR MANAGEMENT

| Subscriber – Code Signing |  No stipulation  |Max 39 months|

See also section 7.1.

### 6.4 ACTIVATION DATA

Activation data refers to data that are required to activate private keys within HSMs. Examples include, but are not limited to, PINs, passphrases, and fragments of private keys used in a split-knowledge scheme.

#### 6.4.1 Activation Data Generation and Installation

Activation data are generated and used following information security best practices and, where applicable, the procedures provided by the HSM manufacturers.

#### 6.4.2 Activation Data Protection

6.4.2.1 CA keys

Activation data are protected by physical (e.g. storage on removable media), logical (e.g. encryption), and procedural measures (e.g. assignment to persons in trusted roles), in compliance with the company’s information security policy and the “dual control” requirement (see par. 6.1.1.1).

6.4.2.2 Subscriber keys

Activation data are protected by the Subscriber so to prevent their disclosure to any unauthorized parties. For further important details on this topic, see paragraph 9.6.3.

#### 6.4.3 Other Aspects of Activation Data

Root CA keys are normally kept in a non-operational state, except when needed for issuing or revoking Subordinate CA certificates or generating CRLs.

### 6.5 COMPUTER SECURITY CONTROLS

#### 6.5.1 Specific computer security technical requirements

The computers used in the CA services run operating systems of proven quality and reliability, configured in such a way as to prevent unauthorized and/or improper use of resources (data, applications, communication channels, etc.).

Where possible and where such functionality is not provided by the operating system itself, anti-malware systems are installed in order to mitigate the risk of "infections" and security attacks. Furthermore, for the same reason, the recommended security patches are installed from time to time.

Computers are subject to a "hardening" procedure aimed at removing or disabling unneeded functionalities, in a specific way on each computer according to the role it plays in the infrastructure.

Privileged access to computers (i.e. as " Administrator") is limited to personnel who actually need it and who have been appointed "System Administrator" in compliance with current legislation.

#### 6.5.2 Computer security rating

No stipulation.

### 6.6 LIFE CYCLE TECHNICAL CONTROLS

#### 6.6.1 System Development Controls

The development of software systems used to support the trust services provided by Actalis, including the CA service, be it carried out by Actalis itself or on behalf of Actalis by contractors, respects the company's Quality Management System (QMS), compliant with the UNI EN ISO 9001 standard: 2015.
For software provided by third parties for the execution of its CA activities, Actalis provides for continuous monitoring of software versioning and upgrades in order to guarantee the highest quality of the services offered.

#### 6.6.2 Security Management Controls

Actalis has in place an Information Security Management System (ISMS), compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, covering all company areas, including those involved in the development and provision of the CA service. 
Among the other provisions of the ISMS, all equipment and software used for Actalis’ trust services (including CA services) is deployed and updated following a documented change management process.

#### 6.6.3 Life Cycle Security Controls

No stipulation.


### 6.7 NETWORK SECURITY CONTROLS

Access to the CA on-line hosts is protected by high quality firewalls that guarantee an adequate filtering of the incoming connections and implement intrusion detection functionalities. Before the firewalls, a series of routers that implement suitable ACLs (Access Control List) constitute further protection. All the communication ports of the certification servers that are not used are disabled. Only those ports are active which support the protocols and functions required for the operation and functionality of the service.

In order to strengthen the filter against unwanted communications, the entire certification system is split-up into an external zone, internal zone and a De-Militarized Zone (DMZ). Sensitive systems are deployed on the internal zone and cannot be directly accessed from the external zone.

Security assessments, to verify the presence of any network vulnerabilities, are carried out at least annually byindependent experts.

Actalis also complies with the requirements of the “Network and Certificate System Security Requirements” published on https://cabforum.org/working-groups/netsec/.

### 6.8 TIME-STAMPING

The time reference used by Actalis, with which the CA processing systems are kept synchronized, is obtained from a high precision device that guarantees a difference of no more than one second with respect to UTC time.

Actalis also operates a Time-Stamping Authority (TSA) intended for use in signing software when used in conjunction with Actalis Code Signing certificates. No guarantee is offered, and no liability will be accepted for any use of the Actalis TSA other than for signing software in combination with Code Signing certificates.

The Actalis TSA service, compliant with RFC3161 and with the applicable requirements in [CSBR], is available at the following URL: [http://timestamp.actalis.com](http://timestamp.actalis.com)


## 7 CERTIFICATE, CRL AND OCSP PROFILES

### 7.1 CERTIFICATE PROFILE

Unless otherwise requested by the interested parties, qualified certificates according to the eIDAS regulation also comply with the AgID recommendations aimed at fostering the interoperability and use of online services in the Italian context (AgID Determination n.121/2019, and subsequent amendments and additions). Application of the said recommendations is normally declared through the inclusion, in the CertificatePolicies extension (OID 2.5.29.32), of an additional PolicyIdentifier item with value agIDcert (OID 1.3.76.16.6), except where this indication is redundant or inapplicable in view of the requirements of the intended application context.

#### 7.1.1 Version number(s)

All certificates shall be of type X.509 v3.

#### 7.1.2 Certificate content and extensions

All certificates conform to the [RFC 5280] public specification and to the CA/Browser Forum’s [BR], [CSBR] or
[EVGL] according to certificate type and class.

7.1.2.4 All certificates

The CA may include in the certificate further information (e.g. additional extensions and/or additional extension fields or values), provided that such additional information:

1) fully complies with both the [RFC 5280] and CAB Forum Requirements and Guidelines; and
2) cannot mislead Relying Parties about the certificate information verified by the CA.


#### 7.1.3 Algorithm object identifiers

Certificates are normally signed using one of the following algorithms:

| Algorithm name  | Object Identifier |
|--|--|
| sha256WithRSAEncryption |  1.2.840.113549.1.1.11 |

OSCP responses are signed using one of the following algorithms:

| Algorithm name | Object  Identifier |
|--|--|
|sha256WithRSAEncryption  |  1.2.840.113549.1.1.11
|ecdsa-with-SHA256  |  1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 |
| ecdsa-with-SHA384 |  1.2.840.10045.4.3.3 |

#### 7.1.4 Name forms

7.1.4.1 Issuer Information

The content of the certificate Issuer DN field shall match the Subject DN of the Issuing CA to support name chaining as specified in [RFC 5280], section 4.1.2.4.

7.1.4.2 Subject Information in Subscriber certificates

By issuing the Certificate, the CA represents that it followed the procedures set forth in this CPS to verify that, as of the Certificate’s issuance date, all of the Subject Information was accurate. The CA shall not include a Domain Name or IP Address in a Subject attribute except as specified in section 3.2.2.4 or section 3.2.2.5.

7.1.4.2.1 Subject Alternative Name Extension

For all **SSL Server** certificates, the following rule applies:

- The **_SubjectAlternativeNames_** ( **SAN** ) extension must contain at least one item. Each of the items in this extension must be an IP address or an FQDN that the Subscriber either owns or controls. Internal server names or reserved IP addresses are not allowed. See also section 3.1.1.

This extension is marked _critical_ in case the Subject DN is empty.

The underscore character (“_”) is not allowed in FQDNs.

7.1.4.2.2 Subject Distinguished Name Fields

For **DV SSL Server** certificates, the following rules apply:

- The **commonName** attribute (OID 2.5.4.3) of the Subject DN must contain a single IP address or Fully     Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) among those contained in the SAN extension (see previous section). If     a FQDN is too long to fit (> 64 chars), this attribute will be omitted resulting in an empty Subject DN.

- No other Subject DN attributes shall be present.
- The Subject field may be empty in DV SSL Server certificates, e.g., when it cannot accommodate a very     long FQDN (longer that 64 characters).

For **OV SSL Server and Code Signing certificates** , the following rules apply:

- The **_commonName_** (OID 2.5.4.3) attribute of the Subject DN:
    - in an SSL Server certificate, must contain one single IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name        (FQDN) among those contained in the SAN extension (see previous section);
    - in a Code Signing certificate, must contain the same value as the **organizationName** attribute;
- The **_organizationName_** attribute (OID 2.5.4.10) of the Subject DN must contain the name or DBA     (Doing Business As) of the Subscriber. For an SSL Server certificate, it must be the entity that either    owns or controls all the FQDNs and/or IP addresses included in the certificate.


- The **_localityName_** attribute (OID 2.5.4.7) of the Subject DN must contain the name of the locality (e.g.,    city) where the Subscriber is located (main place of business).
- The **_stateOrProvinceName_** attribute (OID 2.5.4.8) of the Subject DN must contain the name of the     province (for Italian organizations) or Region/State (for foreign organizations) where the Subscriber’s     principal place of business is located.
- The **_countryName_** attribute (OID 2.5.4.6) of the Subject DN must contain the ISO 3166 two-letter code (e.g., “IT”) of the country where the Subscriber’s principal place of business is located.

For **EV SSL Server certificates,** the following additional rules also apply:

- The **businessCategory** attribute (OID 2.5.4.15) of the Subject DN must contain the Subscriber’s organization type (either “Private Organization” or “Government Entity”).
- The **_serialNumber_** attribute (OID 2.5.4.5) of the Subject DN must contain the VAT Number or other official registration number of the Subscriber.
- The **_jurisdictionOfIncorporationCountryName_** attribute (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3) of the Subject DN must contain the two-letter ISO 3166 code of the country where the Subscriber’s organization was registered or incorporated.
- The **_streetAddress_** attribute (OID 2.5.4.9) of the Subject DN must contain the address (e.g., street name and building number) of the Subscriber’s main place of business.

For **Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWACs),** the following additional rules also apply:

- The **_organizationIdentifier_** attribute (OID 2.5.4. 97 ) of the Subject DN must be populated according to     the [EVGL].

Note: in the case of QWACs, the **cabfOrganizationIdentifier** extension (OID 2.23.140.3.1) is also added to the certificate (see also paragraph 7.1.2.3.6) and is populated according to the [EVGL].

7.1.4.3 Subject Information in Subordinate CA certificates

By issuing a Subordinate CA Certificate, Actalis represents that it followed the procedure set forth in this CPS to verify that, as of the certificate’s issuance date, all of the Subject Information was accurate.

#### 7.1.5 Name constraints

Actalis may issue, subject to a contractual agreement, Subordinate CA certificates to external entities, signed by an Actalis’ root CA key. In such a case, the Subordinate CA certificate will be technically constrained in compliance with section 7.1.5 of the [BR].

#### 7.1.6 Certificate policy object identifier

See section 1.4.

#### 7.1.7 Usage of Policy Constraints extension

Not applicable.

#### 7.1.8 Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

See section 7.1.


#### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical Certificate Policies extension

Not applicable.

### 7.2 CRL PROFILE

The CRLs shall conform to public specification [RFC 5280].

Besides the mandatory information, the CRLs also contain:

- _nextUpdate_ (date for next issue of CRL)
- _cRLNumber_ (sequential number of CRL)

CRLs are signed with the sha256WithRSAEncryption algorithm (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11).

#### 7.2.1 Version Number(s)

The version of CRL is v2 (1).

#### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL entry extensions

Associated with each CRL entry, the _reasonCode_ extension is used to indicate the reason of revocation.

For SSL Certificates issued on or after October 1, 2022, when an SSL certificate is revoked for one of the following reasons, the specified CRLReason is included in the reasonCode extension of the corresponding CRL entry. Otherwise, the CRLReason code is omitted:

- _keyCompromise_ (1)
- _affiliationChanged_ (3)
- _superseded_ (4)
- _privilegeWithdrawn_ (5)
- _cessationOfOperation_ (9)

### 7.3 OCSP PROFILE

The OSCP service shall conform to public specification [RFC6960].

OCSP responses are not signed with the private key of the issuing CA, but rather with a specific key of the OCSPresponder. Therefore, the OCSP responder’s certificate contains the **ocspSigning** (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) key purpose in its ExtendedKeyUsage extension. The OCSP responder’s certificate also contains the **id-pkix-ocsp-no-check** (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5) extension.

OCSP responses conforms to the “pkix-ocsp-basic” profile (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.1).

#### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

The version of OCSP responses is v1 (0).

#### 7.3.2 OCSP extensions

OCSP responses contain the Nonce extension (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2).


## 8 COMPLIANCE AUDITS AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

Actalis shall issue certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with applicable law and comply with CAB Forum’s requirements [BR] and guidelines [EVGL].

### 8.1 FREQUENCY OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF ASSESSMENT

The compliance of the Actalis’ CA services to this CPS, to Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 ("eIDAS"), to the applicable ETSI standards and to the [BR] and [EVGL] requirements is verified on an annual basis by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body (CAB).

Moreover, always on an annual basis, an internal auditing activity is performed on the CA services that also takes into account aspects related to information security, applicable data protection rules and internal policies and procedures.

### 8.2 IDENTITY AND QUALIFICATION OF ASSESSOR

Compliance audits on the CA are carried out by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) accredited in compliance with Regulation (EC) no. 765/2008, through personnel that is qualified and competent on the subject of conformity assessments, according to the ETSI EN 319 403 norm, of Trust Service Providers and the related trust services provided under the eIDAS Regulation. Any second part audits are also performed by accredited bodies in compliance with Regulation (EC) no. 765/2008.

### 8.3 ASSESSOR’S RELATIONSHIP TO ASSESSED ENTITY

The Assessment Bodies (CABs) that perform audits on the CA service, and possibly on the external RAs that collaborate with the CA, have no relation with Actalis.

The internal auditor does not belong to the organizational structure that deals with CA activities.

### 8.4 TOPICS COVERED BY ASSESSMENT

External audits shall evaluate, based on the ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN 319 411-2 norms, the compliance with the [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL], and the proper operation of the CA as described in this CPS, including any Delegates Third Parties (DTPs) that are not "Enterprise RA", with the exception of any "technically constrained" subordinated CAs (see par. 1.3.1).

Non-compliant DTPs cannot continue to perform the functions delegated to them until the non-conformities have been completely remediated.

### 8.5 ACTIONS TAKEN AS A RESULT OF DEFICIENCY

The actions resulting from any non-compliance detected during audits (failure to meet the requirements defined in the regulations, standards, and applicable procedures) depend on the nature and severity of the non-compliance detected, on the rules for the management of non-compliances defined by the Assessment Body (CAB) and/or the internal non-conformity management procedures.

In general, if a substantive non-compliance results from an audit, Actalis will develop a plan to remedy this non-compliance as quickly as possible. This plan could result in changes to CA certification policies and/or practices, and/or to the CA software. The plan will be presented to the Actalis direction for approval, and then to any third parties with whom Actalis has commitments in this regard.


### 8.6 COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS

The result of the audit carried out by the CAB is communicated to the company management and to the heads of the organizational structure in charge of providing the CA service. The result of the audit is also communicated to the national Supervisory Body (AgID) by sending to them the audit report issued by the CAB.

The CA publishes the result of the audit within three months of the end of the audit period.

The result of internal audits or second-party audits is communicated to the company management, to the heads of the organizational structure responsible for providing the CA service and, where applicable, to the involved external entity/organization.

### 8.7 SELF-AUDITS

During the period in which the CA issues certificates, the CA shall monitor adherence to this CPS (and linked documents if any) and to the [BR], [CSBR] and [EVGL] requirements, and strictly control its service quality, by performing self-audits on at least a quarterly basis. Self-audits shall be carried out against a randomly selected sample of at least three percent of the certificates issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken, also using linting techniques and tools.
