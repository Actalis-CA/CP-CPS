Actalis' Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for publicly trusted certificates (TLS, Code Signing, S/MIME)

This is a combined CP/CPS document relevant to the issuance and management of these types of certificates:
* SSL Server certificates
* Code Signing certificates
* S/MIME certificates

For S/MIME certificates only, there is a separate CP document [here](/CP/SMIME.md).
