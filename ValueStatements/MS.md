# Value Statement for Microsoft
Actalis operates a robust and mature Public Key Infrastructure for SSL/TLS, S/MIME, Code Signing, and Time Stamping certificates, fully compliant with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements and the policies of major Root Store Programs. The Certification Authority's governance and technical controls are further reinforced by its status as a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) under the EU eIDAS Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, as amended), and by regular audits performed by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body in accordance with ETSI EN 319 411-1/-2 standards.

The inclusion of our new RootCA certificates in the Microsoft Root Store is an operational necessity to ensure continuity of service of our existing worldwide subscriber base, mainly based in Europe. Our currently trusted RootCA, already included in the Microsoft Root Store, is scheduled for planned decommissioning in the next few years, and the introduction of additional RootCAs will ensure a smooth operational transition and the continued trust of all relying parties and end users

Our new RootCAs adopt stronger cryptographic algorithms and segregated hierarchies, and are designed in full alignment with the latest TLS, S/MIME and Code Signing certificate management policies and lifecycle practices, ensuring continuous adherence to evolving security and compliance requirements.

Actalis is already a trusted participant in the Microsoft Root Store and CAB Forum ecosystem. This request does not introduce new services, but rather extends existing trust anchors to preserve the stability, reliability, and interoperability of our TLS services for public sector subscribers across Europe and entire world. Given our proven compliance record, transparent publication of audit results, and absence of significant incidents or mass revocations, the inclusion of these additional RootCAs presents minimal oversight burden for the Microsoft Root Program while strengthening overall trust and resilience within the global Web PKI.
